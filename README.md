# Snake Game for coding round

● Create a 26 x 26 square matrix grid.
● Random highlight any one Dot from Grid
● Snake should move as per the navigation actions.
● Any highlighted dot should be highlighted maximum 40 sec at one position.
● Immediately highlight another point if the snake cross the highlighted Dot.
● If snake cross any highlighted Dot then it should be increment score by 1
● Snake should start moving once we press the start button.
● Snake should stop moving once we press the stop button.
● If a snake touches the border line then it would start from the opposite side of the
same line.
● Default snake length is 3 Dots.
● Default moving direction is Left -> Right.
● Default moving speed is 1 sec. (move 1 dot per second)
● Default snake position at 3x13
● Default snake state is stopped

I have used yarn for this, so if you run into problems using npm, 
just use "yarn start"

I have added a few extra mechanics other than what was mentioned in the question:

● The snake grows by 1 dot each time it consumes the food.
● If the snake bites itself, it will trigger a game over alert.
